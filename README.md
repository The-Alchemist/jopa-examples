# JOPA Examples

This repository contains some usage examples of the [JOPA framework](https://github.com/kbss-cvut/jopa).

### Examples

1. Example01 - JOPA with a Sesame in-memory storage, working with object model generated by OWL2Java
2. Example02 - JOPA using OWLAPI-accessed files as storage
3. Example03 - JOPA with a native Sesame storage utilizing its contexts to store and access data in different RDF named graphs
4. Example04 - Full-blown Java web application with Spring, REST services, ReactJS-based UI and JOPA with Sesame native storage
5. Example05 - JOPA utilizing [OWL2Query](https://kbss.felk.cvut.cz/web/portal/owl2query) - a SPARQL-DL query engine for OWLAPI

Each example has its own README file with a more detailed description. Note that JOPA requires Java 8.
